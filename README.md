## Section 1: Min Max Amplitude 
The minimum and maximum values of a ten second audio file were determined using the pdm microphone of a Nexys A7 100T board to stream in data and then display each value on the two seven-segment displays.
## Section 2: Dynamic Noise Compression
Using the same ten second audio file the audio was compressed by a specific user defined threshold and then streamed out the board via the mono audio output.
